# JavaScript Lab 2

## Overview

JavaScript Lab 2 focuses on understanding and implementing various control flow structures in JavaScript, including loops and scope. The lab covers the following key concepts:

1. **For Loop**
2. **While Loop**
3. **Do...While Loop**
4. **Scope of Variables**

## Contents

### For Loop

The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. In this lab, we used a `for` loop to print numbers from 0 to 4, skipping the number 3.

### While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. In this lab, we used a `while` loop to print numbers from 0 to 5, skipping the number 3.

### Do...While Loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. In this lab, we used a `do...while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5, skipping the number 3.

### Scope of Variables

Understanding the scope of variables is crucial in JavaScript. In this lab, we explored the difference between global and local variables.

#### Global Variable

A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.

#### Local Variable

A local variable is accessible only within the function where it is declared.

#### Returning Local Variable

To access a local variable outside its function, you can return it.

## Conclusion

JavaScript Lab 2 provided hands-on experience with loops and variable scope, reinforcing the understanding of these fundamental concepts in JavaScript.
